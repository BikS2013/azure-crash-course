## Conclusion

The wrapper.py file provides a comprehensive object-oriented interface for working with Azure services. By abstracting away much of the complexity of the Azure SDK, it makes it easier to:

1. Authenticate with Azure
2. Manage Azure resources
3. Work with Azure Storage
4. Create and use Azure AI Search indexes
5. Integrate with Azure OpenAI services

The hierarchical structure of the classes mirrors Azure's resource organization, making it intuitive to understand and use. By following the examples and best practices in this documentation, you can effectively leverage the wrapper to build applications that utilize Azure's powerful cloud services.

### Extending the Wrapper

If you need to extend the wrapper to support additional Azure services or functionality:

1. Follow the existing class hierarchy pattern
2. Create new classes that represent Azure resources
3. Use composition to maintain the relationship between resources
4. Add factory methods to create or retrieve instances
5. Implement methods that map to common operations on the resource

For example, to add support for Azure Cosmos DB:

```python
class CosmosDBAccount:
    resource_group: ResourceGroup
    cosmos_account: Any  # Azure Cosmos DB account object
    
    def __init__(self, resource_group: ResourceGroup, cosmos_account: Any):
        self.resource_group = resource_group
        self.cosmos_account = cosmos_account
        
    # Add methods for common operations
    def get_database(self, database_name: str) -> "CosmosDatabase":
        # Implementation
        pass
        
    def create_database(self, database_name: str) -> "CosmosDatabase":
        # Implementation
        pass
```

Then add methods to the ResourceGroup class to create or retrieve CosmosDBAccount instances:

```python
def get_cosmos_account(self, account_name: str) -> "CosmosDBAccount":
    # Implementation
    pass
    
def create_cosmos_account(self, account_name: str, location: str) -> "CosmosDBAccount":
    # Implementation
    pass
```

By following this pattern, you can maintain the consistency and intuitiveness of the wrapper while extending its functionality.
